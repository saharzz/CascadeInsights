Her methodological work focuses on developing statistical methods for addressing missingness and non-random selection, particularly when missingness or selection depends on unobserved factors (missing not at random). Her collaborative research addresses population health and health equity across biomedical and epidemiological domains. She is a Clinical Associate Professor at the University of Washington, where she teaches graduate courses and mentors students.</p>

                <p class="spaced-paragraph">We are a statistical consultancy firm based in Seattle, WA. We provide biostatistical services for the design and analysis of common study designs, such as prospective randomized trials, as well as specialized consulting on complex study designs, integration of generative artificial intelligence methods, and statistical approaches for collection, integration, and analysis of complex and real-world data. Our services include methodological guidance, statistical analysis, educational training, and technical support for industry, academic, and governmental clients. Please visit our <a href="services.html">services</a> page to learn more about how we can help.</p>
                
                <p class="spaced-paragraph">Our name pays homage to the Cascades, a major mountain range in western North America. The name also underscores three elements of statistical consulting that are at the core of our practice: (1) study design and analysis plans have a cascading effect on quality and relevance of insights; (2) similar to mountains in the range, each study has distinct features that may differ from others and would require unique approaches and perspectives; and (3) just as the Cascades shape the continent's climate through their collective presence rather than individual peaks, statistical practice achieves impact through collaboration and partnerships.</p>
