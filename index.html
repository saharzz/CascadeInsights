                <p class="subtitle"><strong>Statistical Consulting</strong></p>

                <p class="spaced-paragraph">We are a boutique Statistical Consultancy firm based in Seattle WA. We provide specialized statistical consulting services on complex study designs and integration of generative artificial intelligence methods with traditional statistical approaches for design and analysis of complex data sets. This includes methodological guidance, statistical analysis, educational training, and technical support to academic, industry, governmental and non-governmental clients.</p>

                <p class="spaced-paragraph">We are a local company with global reach. Our name pays homage to the Cascades, a major mountain range in western North America. The name also underscores three elements of statistical consulting that are at the core of our practice: (1) study design and analysis plans have a cascading effect on quality and relevance of insights; (2) similar to mountains in the range, each study has distinct features that may differ from others and would require unique approaches and perspectives; and (3) just as the Cascades shape the continent's climate through their collective presence rather than individual peaks, statistical practice achieves impact through collaboration and partnerships.</p>
